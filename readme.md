This project was a semester-long class project that was part of my Principles of Data Management class.

Throughout the semester we had to plan and design a database using different models, construct a simple application to interface with the database, and perform some simple data analysis on the data we were given

This repository is the collection of all the coding that we had to do for the project, including mock data we had to generate to test our code.
